Comparison Report: Two Sum Solutions  using chatgpt
====================================

Problem Statement:
------------------
Given a list of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.

My Solution
-----------------
Code Summary:
-------------
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            y = target - nums[i]
            if y in nums and nums.index(y) != i:
                return [i, nums.index(y)]

How It Works:
- Loops through each number.
- Computes the complement `y = target - nums[i]`.
- Checks if `y` exists in the list.
- Returns indices using `.index()`.

Drawbacks:
----------
- `in nums` is O(n): For each number, checks if complement exists — slow for large lists.
- `.index()` is O(n): Called every iteration — makes overall time complexity O(n²).
- Fails with duplicates: If the same number appears twice (like `[3, 3]`), `.index()` may return the same index for both.

Time Complexity: O(n²)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Optimized Solution (Hash Table)
-------------------------------
Code Summary:
-------------
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        sec = dict()
        for ind, num in enumerate(nums):
            if target - num not in sec:
                sec[num] = ind
                continue
            return [ind, sec[target - num]]

How It Works:
- Uses a dictionary (`sec`) to store numbers and their indices as we loop.
- For each number, checks if the complement exists in the dictionary.
- Returns the indices immediately when a match is found.

Benefits:
---------
- Hash table lookup is O(1): Much faster than `in nums` or `.index()`.
- Only one loop: True O(n) time complexity.
- Handles duplicates properly: Keeps track of all positions.
- Returns early: Stops as soon as a solution is found.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

Test Case Example: [3, 3], Target = 6
-------------------------------------
Original: Fails or returns [0, 0]
Optimized: Correctly returns [1, 0] or [0, 1]

Summary Table

| Feature                   | Original Solution      | Optimized Solution       |
|---------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Time Complexity           | O(n²)                  | O(n)                      |
| Space Complexity          | O(1)                   | O(n)                      |
| Handles duplicates        | No                     | Yes                       |
| Performance on large input| Slower                 | Fast                      |
| Code readability          | Simple, but less safe  | Slightly longer, more reliable |

Conclusion
----------
The optimized solution using a hash table is significantly faster, safer, and more scalable, especially for large inputs or duplicate numbers. 
It is the preferred solution in professional and interview settings.
